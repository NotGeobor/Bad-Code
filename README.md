# Bad-Code
Misc Projects

The worst of the worst. Please feel free to call my coding bad and tell me how it's supposed to be done. A lot of this was made in wsl and dosen't work in Windows.


Accounts:

Basic account system. Made to test importing custom scripts, classes, file handling, encoding basics, and json.


Physics Equations:

Random physics equations I use for a highschool AP physics course.


Steam Game Mover 10000000000:

Moves my steam games from my 2nd drive, which used to be a NAS to anywhere else. Made after learning Tkinter basics and turned out decent, so will probably make more GUI apps.


Barely Better Timer:

Like the Terrible Timer, but barely better.


Gayness Checker:

Checkes the gayness of a word. Was like the 3rd thing I made. I purposely made it slow and look like it's doing a lot of stuff. Truly some spaghetti code.


Password Generator:

Made for highschool AP computer science course. It generates a password from whatever you put in. They wanted it in scratch but there was no way I was doing this in scratch.


Snake:

Probably the worst snake game ever made. Was like my 4th project and I used no tutorial. Lets you choose the grid size but breaks with anything other than 10x10. Doesn't even update moves automagically.


Terrible Timer:

Counts down a number. Was my first project. I tried to make as inefficient a timer as possible. This was originally on scratch and I learned Python in a few hours to port this.


Torrent Script:

Finally made in windows without wsl. Used to remove some unnecessary tracks from mkv torrent and rename a series for use on plex.
